# Powershell in a Month of Lunches
This repository contains my notes on the book [Powershell in a Month of Lunches](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learn-windows-powershell/9781617294167/kindle_split_014.html) by Don Jones and Jeffery Hicks.

I will be answering the questions posed in the lab activities and documenting my thought process to reach my conclusions.

I will also be noting any points in the book that I find interesting, in my own words.
